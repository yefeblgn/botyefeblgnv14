And there are two ways to get premium:\n\n**1 - BOOST ON MY [SUPPORT SERVER]({{SupportServer}})**\nA little boost wouldn't hurt, right? Besides making my support server more resourceful, it will allow me to send really cool emojis in my messages.\nAlso, boost on support server is equivalent to **30 days of PREMIUM**, and any user of your server or any friend, can boost my server and activate the premium on your server for you, if you do not have discord nitro.\n\n**2 - Hope VOTES**\nBy voting for me, you help me get more visibility so more cool people like you can have me on their servers.\nYou can check the list of botlists available for reward with the `{{prefix}}vote` command\nOh, and each vote is equivalent to **12 hours of PREMIUM**, and you can vote every 12 hours.",
